      "content": "# Operating Models for AI\n\n## WHY This Matters\n\nIndividual AI projects can succeed with ad-hoc approaches. AI at scale cannot.\n\nWhen AI moves from pilots to production, from one team to many, organizations need:\n\n- Clear ownership and accountability\n- Consistent standards and practices\n- Efficient resource allocation\n- Systematic learning and improvement\n- Appropriate risk management\n\nThe operating model is what makes AI scalable, sustainable, and safe. Without it, you get fragmented efforts, duplicated work, inconsistent quality, and ungovernable risk.\n\n---\n\n## WHAT You Need to Know\n\n### Operating Model Components\n\n### The Organizational Models\n\nThree primary patterns for organizing AI capability:\n\n**Model 1: Centralized (Center of Excellence)**\n\n<figure class=\"diagram\">\n  <img src=\"/diagrams/org-model-centralized.svg\" alt=\"Centralized AI CoE model where all AI talent and work flows through a central team to business units\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n</figure>\n\n**Model 2: Federated (Hub and Spoke)**\n\n<figure class=\"diagram\">\n  <img src=\"/diagrams/org-model-federated.svg\" alt=\"Federated AI model where each business unit has its own AI team with loose coordination\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n</figure>\n\n**Model 3: Hybrid (Matrix)** *(Recommended)*\n\n<figure class=\"diagram\">\n  <img src=\"/diagrams/org-model-hybrid.svg\" alt=\"Hybrid AI model combining a central CoE for standards and expertise with embedded AI talent in each business unit\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n</figure>\n\n### Choosing the Right Model\n\n| Factor | Favors Centralized | Favors Federated | Favors Hybrid |\n|--------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|\n| AI maturity | Low | Medium-High | Medium |\n| Org size | Small-Medium | Large | Medium-Large |\n| BU diversity | Low | High | Medium |\n| Talent availability | Scarce | Available | Mixed |\n| Regulation intensity | High | Low | Medium |\n\n### The Center of Excellence Model\n\nFor most enterprises starting their AI journey, a CoE is the right foundation:\n\n### Governance Design\n\n| Decision Type | Who Decides | Who Advises | Who Executes |\n|---------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|\n| AI strategy & vision | Executive sponsor | CoE, BU leaders | CoE |\n| Investment allocation | Steering committee | CoE, Finance | BU leaders |\n| Standards & policies | CoE | Legal, Security, Risk | CoE |\n| Use case approval | Tiered (see below) | CoE, Risk | BU teams |\n| Vendor selection | IT + CoE | Procurement | CoE |\n| Incident response | CoE + Risk | Legal | Response team |\n\n**Tiered Use Case Approval:**\n\n| Tier | Risk Level | Approver | Review Requirements |\n|------|------------|----------|---------------------|\n| 1 | Low (internal, non-critical) | Manager | Self-assessment |\n| 2 | Medium (customer-facing, review) | CoE | CoE review |\n| 3 | High (autonomous, sensitive) | Steering committee | Full governance review |\n\n### Scaling Patterns\n\nAs AI matures, the operating model evolves:\n\n**Stage 1: Seed (0-6 months)**\n- Small core team (2-4 people)\n- Focus on first pilots\n- Establish initial standards\n- Prove value\n\n**Stage 2: Grow (6-18 months)**\n- Formal CoE structure\n- First production deployments\n- Training programs launched\n- Governance established\n\n**Stage 3: Scale (18-36 months)**\n- Federated teams emerge\n- Self-service capabilities\n- Mature governance\n- Measured value delivery\n\n**Stage 4: Pervasive (36+ months)**\n- AI embedded everywhere\n- CoE becomes strategic advisor\n- Continuous improvement\n- Industry leadership\n\n### Critical Success Factors\n\n| Factor | Description | Warning Signs |\n|--------|-------------|---------------|\n| **Executive sponsorship** | Active, visible support from C-suite | AI buried in IT, no strategic priority |\n| **Clear ownership** | Unambiguous accountability | \"Everyone's responsibility\" = nobody's |\n| **Funding model** | Sustainable investment approach | Project-by-project begging |\n| **Talent strategy** | Build, buy, borrow plan | Always short on skills |\n| **Change management** | Systematic adoption approach | Tech deployed, nobody uses it |\n\n---\n\n## HOW to Apply This\n\n### Exercise: Design Your Operating Model\n\n### Operating Model Canvas\n\n```\nAI OPERATING MODEL CANVAS\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nORGANIZATIONAL
