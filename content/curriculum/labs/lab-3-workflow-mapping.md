# Lab 3: Workflow Mapping

## Lab Overview

In this lab, you'll analyze a real workflow and identify specific opportunities for AI integration. You'll practice the systematic process analysis skills that separate strategic AI operators from those who apply AI randomly.

**What you'll create:**
- A detailed workflow map
- AI suitability scores for each step
- A prioritized AI integration roadmap

---

## Part 1: Select Your Workflow (5 minutes)

### Choose one of these workflows to analyze:

**Option A: Content Creation Pipeline**
How content (blog posts, reports, marketing materials) goes from idea to publication.

**Option B: Customer Onboarding**
How new customers get from signed contract to actively using your product/service.

**Option C: Hiring Process**
How candidates go from job posting to hired employee.

**Option D: Monthly Reporting**
How data becomes insights becomes decision-making documents.

**Option E: Your Choice**
A workflow you know well from your work or experience.

*If you don't have direct experience, choose one and research or imagine the typical steps.*

## Part 2: Document Current State (15 minutes)

### Map Every Step

For your chosen workflow, document each step using this format:

```
STEP [#]: [Name]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Trigger: What causes this step to start?
Owner: Who is responsible?
Input: What does this step receive?
Actions: What happens? (bullet points)
Output: What is produced?
Duration: How long does it take?
Tools used: What systems/tools?
Dependencies: What must happen first?
Pain points: What problems occur here?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Document at least 8-10 steps

Include steps that might seem minor—they often hide AI opportunities.

### Identify Bottlenecks

Mark which steps are bottlenecks:
- Where does work pile up?
- Where are the longest delays?
- Where do errors most often occur?

---

## Part 3: Score AI Suitability (10 minutes)

### Score Each Step

For every step in your workflow, rate these factors (1-5):

| Factor | 1 (Low) | 5 (High) |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Repetitiveness** | Unique every time | Same task repeatedly |
| **Data intensity** | Minimal data | Heavy data processing |
| **Time consumption** | Seconds | Hours |
| **Quality variance** | Always consistent | Quality varies |
| **Criteria clarity** | Highly subjective | Clear right/wrong |

### Calculate AI Suitability Score

**Total score = Sum of all factors**

| Score | AI Potential | Recommendation |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| 20-25 | Very High | Prioritize for AI automation |
| 15-19 | High | Strong AI assist candidate |
| 10-14 | Medium | Selective AI support |
| 5-9 | Low | Keep human-led |

### Complete the Scoring Matrix

| Step | Rep. | Data | Time | Var. | Clarity | Total | AI Potential |
|------|------|------|------|------|---------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | | | | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | | | |
| ... | | | | | | | |

## Part 4: Identify AI Opportunities (10 minutes)

### For Each High-Potential Step

Document the AI opportunity:

```
OPPORTUNITY: [Step name]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Current state: [What happens now]

AI integration type:
☐ Automate (AI does it independently)
☐ Assist (AI helps human do it faster)
☐ Augment (AI provides inputs for human decision)

What AI would do: [Specific description]

Expected benefits:
- Time saved: [Estimate]
- Quality improvement: [Describe]
- Other value: [Describe]

Requirements:
- Data needed: [What AI needs access to]
- Integration: [Systems AI must connect with]
- Human oversight: [What verification needed]

Risks:
- [Risk 1]
- [Risk 2]

Implementation complexity: Low / Medium / High
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Identify 4-6 AI Opportunities

Focus on steps with the highest AI suitability scores.

---

## Part 5: Create Integration Roadmap (10 minutes)

### Prioritization Matrix

Plot your opportunities on this matrix:

```
HIGH    │ ★ Quick Wins      │ ★ Strategic Bets
IMPACT  │ (Do first)        │ (Plan carefully)
        │                   │
        ├───────────────────┼───────────────────
        │                   │
LOW     │ Fill-ins          │ Avoid
IMPACT  │ (Do if easy)      │ (Don't bother)
        │                   │
        └───────────────────┴───────────────────
              LOW EFFORT         HIGH EFFORT
```

### Create Phased Roadmap

**Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 1-2)**
- [Opportunity 1]
- [Opportunity 2]

**Phase 2: Core Integration (Month 1-2)**
- [Opportunity 3]
- [Opportunity 4]

**Phase 3: Advanced (Quarter 1-2)**
- [Opportunity 5]
- [Opportunity 6]

### Success Metrics

For each phase, define:
- What will be measured?
- What's the target improvement?
- How will you know it's working?

---

## Part 6: Visualize the Future State (5 minutes)

### Create Before/After Comparison

**Before (Current State):**
```
[Step 1] → [Step 2] → [Step 3] → [Step 4] → ...
  ↓          ↓          ↓          ↓
[Pain]    [Pain]     [Pain]     [Pain]
```

**After (AI-Enhanced):**
```
[Step 1]    →   [AI: Step 2+3]   →   [Step 4]   → ...
    ↓               ↓                   ↓
[Improved]      [New AI]           [Enhanced]
```

Show which steps are:
- Eliminated
- Automated
- Augmented
- Unchanged
