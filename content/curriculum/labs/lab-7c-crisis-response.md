# Lab 7c: Crisis Response Simulation

## Lab Overview

The research on consulting talent development identifies a critical gap: professionals need "five years of rare crisis events compressed into focused training." You can study crisis management frameworks, but until you've made decisions under pressure with incomplete information, you're not prepared.

This lab simulates four AI-related crises. Each scenario unfolds over a compressed timeline, requiring you to make decisions, communicate with stakeholders, and manage consequences—all while the clock is ticking.

**What you'll experience:**
- Time-pressured decision-making
- Incomplete information scenarios
- Stakeholder communication under stress
- Consequence management
- Post-crisis analysis

**Important:** These scenarios are designed to be uncomfortable. Real crises are uncomfortable. Lean into the discomfort—that's where the learning happens.

---

## Before You Start

### Mindset

Approach this lab as if the scenarios are real:
- Make decisions even when you're uncertain
- Communicate as you would with actual stakeholders
- Accept that some decisions will have negative consequences
- Focus on learning, not on being "right"

### Materials Needed

- Timer or clock (you'll be timed)
- Note-taking tool for decisions and communications
- AI Sandbox open for stakeholder simulations (optional but recommended)

## Crisis 2: The Failed Pilot (15 minutes)

### Scenario

**THE SITUATION**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
URGENT: Board Meeting in 24 Hours
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Context: 3 months ago, you championed an AI pilot for automated
invoice processing. The CFO approved $200K based on your projections
of 60% cost savings. The pilot was highly visible—featured in the
company newsletter and discussed at the last board meeting.

Results Just In:
- Accuracy: 67% (target was 95%)
- Time savings: -10% (took LONGER than manual process)
- Staff sentiment: "We spent more time correcting errors"
- Vendor says: "You didn't provide enough training data"
- IT says: "Vendor's requirements kept changing"

Tomorrow's Board Meeting:
- The pilot is on the agenda as a "success story update"
- The CFO expects you to present positive results
- The CEO has already mentioned the pilot to analysts

Your executive sponsor (VP of Finance) just called:
"I just saw these numbers. What the hell happened? I vouched for
you on this. The board meets tomorrow."
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Your Task (5 minutes)

**START YOUR TIMER.**

**Decision 1: Response to VP**
You have to call the VP back in 10 minutes. What do you say?

Key points:
- ________________________________
- ________________________________
- ________________________________

What you will NOT say: ________________________________

**Decision 2: Board Presentation**
You cannot hide the results—that would be career-ending. How do you frame this?

Option A: Lead with the failure, explain learnings
Option B: Lead with learnings, explain results in context
Option C: Request to postpone presentation for more analysis
Option D: Present results as "Phase 1" with Phase 2 plan

Your choice: ________________________________

Rationale: ________________________________

**Decision 3: Accountability & Path Forward**
Write 3 bullets each:

What went wrong (honest assessment):
- ________________________________
- ________________________________
- ________________________________

What you're proposing next:
- ________________________________
- ________________________________
- ________________________________

**STOP when your 5-minute timer goes off.**

```
You are Janet Morrison, VP of Finance. You're angry and stressed.
You vouched for an AI pilot that just failed publicly. You have to
face the board tomorrow.

YOUR SITUATION:
- You trusted this person's projections
- You defended the $200K spend to the CFO
- The CEO mentioned this pilot to analysts
- Your credibility is damaged

YOUR CONVERSATION STYLE:
- Initially angry: "What happened? These numbers are a disaster."
- Looking for accountability—do they own it or make excuses?
- Want a concrete plan to present tomorrow
- Will become more constructive if they show ownership

Start by saying: "I have five minutes before my next call. Explain
these numbers to me."
```

Have the conversation. Note what worked and what didn't.

## Crisis 3: The Scope Creep (15 minutes)

### Scenario

**THE SITUATION**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PROJECT: AI Customer Support Assistant
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Original Scope (approved 6 months ago):
- Automated FAQ responses (100 common questions)
- Ticket classification and routing
- Budget: $150K | Timeline: 6 months | Team: 3 people

Current Situation (Month 4):
- FAQ and routing: 80% complete
- Remaining budget: $35K
- Timeline: On track for original scope

NEW REQUEST (yesterday):
The Chief Customer Officer (CCO) just returned from a conference
and saw a competitor's AI that does live agent assistance—real-time
suggestions during calls. She's now demanding this be added:

"I need live agent assistance. Our competitor has it. This is now
the top priority. We cannot launch without it."

Reality Check:
- Live agent assistance would add: ~$200K and 4 months
- Current budget remaining: $35K
- CCO controls 40% of your project funding
- CCO is known for changing priorities frequently
- Your team is already stretched

Your project sponsor (CIO) messages you:
"The CCO just called me. She wants agent assistance added.
What are our options?"
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Your Task (5 minutes)

**START YOUR TIMER.**

**Decision 1: Immediate Response to CIO**

| B | Add scope with new budget | | | | |
| C | Deliver original scope, Phase 2 for rest | | | | |
| D | Reduce original scope to fit new request | | | | |

Your recommended option: ________________________________

**Decision 3: CCO Meeting Prep**
You'll meet with the CCO in 2 hours. Prepare:

## Crisis 4: The Ethics Alarm (15 minutes)

### Scenario

**THE SITUATION**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CONFIDENTIAL: Bias Discovery
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Context: Your team deployed an AI-powered loan pre-screening tool
6 months ago. It's processed 45,000 applications and is credited
with 30% efficiency gains. Leadership loves it.

Discovery (today):
A junior analyst ran an ad-hoc analysis and found that the AI
approves applications from certain ZIP codes at significantly
lower rates—even controlling for credit score and income.

The ZIP codes with lower approval rates have predominantly
minority populations.

The Numbers:
- Majority-white ZIP codes: 62% pre-approval rate
- Majority-minority ZIP codes: 41% pre-approval rate
- Difference persists when controlling for income/credit score

Complications:
- The AI vendor says it's "working as designed"
- Legal says this could be a Fair Lending Act violation
- The CMO is about to launch a campaign featuring the AI tool
- 45,000 applications have already been processed
- Some of those applicants may have been wrongly denied

The VP of Lending just walked into your office:
"I heard there's an issue with the AI. Tell me this isn't
a discrimination lawsuit waiting to happen."
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Your Task (5 minutes)

**START YOUR TIMER.**

**Decision 1: Immediate Response to VP**
What do you say RIGHT NOW?

What you confirm: ________________________________

What you need to investigate: ________________________________

What you recommend immediately: ________________________________

**Decision 2: Immediate vs. Thorough**
You face a classic crisis trade-off:

Option A: Pause the AI immediately
- Pros: Stops potential ongoing harm
- Cons: Disrupts operations, may be overreaction if analysis is flawed

Option B: Continue while investigating
- Pros: Maintains operations, allows thorough analysis
- Cons: Potential ongoing harm, legal exposure if it's real

Your decision: ________________________________

Your rationale: ________________________________

**Decision 3: Stakeholder Notification**
Who needs to know what, and when?

| Stakeholder | Timing | What to Tell Them | What NOT to Tell |
|-------------|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| General Counsel | | | |
| CEO | | | |
| CMO (marketing) | | | |
| AI Vendor | | | |
| Board | | | |
| Public | | | |

### Two Days Later Update

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
INVESTIGATION RESULTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Findings:
- The bias is real and statistically significant
- Root cause: Training data reflected historical lending patterns
  that were themselves biased
- The AI is not explicitly using race—but ZIP code and other
  factors serve as proxies
- Vendor admits they didn't test for disparate impact
- Legal estimates 2,000-3,000 applicants may have been wrongly
  denied or offered worse terms

Decisions Needed:
1. What to do about the 2,000-3,000 affected applicants
2. What to do about the AI tool going forward
3. What to tell regulators (proactive disclosure vs. wait)
4. What to tell the public
5. What to do about the vendor relationship
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Your Task (5 minutes)

**START YOUR TIMER.**

**Decision 4: Affected Applicants**
What do you do about the 2,000-3,000 potentially affected?

Options to consider:
- Proactive outreach and re-review
- Wait for complaints
- Offer compensation/remediation
- Something else

Your recommendation: ________________________________

Rationale: ________________________________

**Decision 5: Public Disclosure**
Draft the key messages for public communication:

What you acknowledge: ________________________________

What you're doing about it: ________________________________

What you're changing: ________________________________

Tone: ________________________________

**Decision 6: Lessons Learned**
What governance should have prevented this?

- ________________________________
- ________________________________
- ________________________________

**STOP when your 5-minute timer goes off.**

### Reflection (3 minutes)

1. Did the "efficiency gains" make this crisis easier or harder to address?

2. When did you first consider the affected applicants as people, not numbers?

3. What bias testing should have been done before deployment?
