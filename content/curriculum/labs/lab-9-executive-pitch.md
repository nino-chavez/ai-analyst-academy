# Lab 9: The Executive Pitch

## Lab Overview

The best AI ideas die in conference rooms every day—not because they're bad ideas, but because they're poorly pitched. In this lab, you'll develop a complete executive pitch for an AI initiative, including stakeholder analysis, objection handling, and presentation materials.

**What you'll create:**
- A comprehensive stakeholder map
- A one-page executive summary
- A pitch deck
- Objection response playbook
- A 5-minute verbal pitch script

## Part 1: Select Your Initiative (10 minutes)

### Choose Your Scenario

**Option A: Real Initiative**
Use an actual AI opportunity in your organization—something you'd genuinely like to propose.

**Option B: Retail/Commerce Scenario**
Propose an AI initiative for a retail company:

```
SCENARIO: Regional Retailer

COMPANY PROFILE

Industry: Home goods retail
Locations: 85 stores across 12 states
Revenue: $420M annually
Employees: 2,800
E-commerce: 22% of revenue, growing 18% YoY

CURRENT CHALLENGES
• Customer service tickets up 34% YoY
• Average response time: 18 hours
• CSAT score: 72% (industry avg: 78%)
• Support team fully staffed, hitting capacity
• Peak seasons cause 3-4 day response delays

OPPORTUNITY
Implement AI-assisted customer service to:
• Reduce first-response time
• Handle routine inquiries automatically
• Free agents for complex issues
• Improve CSAT scores

CONSTRAINTS
• Limited IT team (5 people)
• Risk-averse leadership
• Previous chatbot failure (2022)
• Union considerations for support staff
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Option C: Create Your Own**
Define a different retail/commerce AI initiative that interests you.

### Document Your Initiative

```
