```
QUADRANT SUMMARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

QUICK WINS (High Value + High Feasibility):
Do now—these build credibility and momentum
•
•
•

BIG BETS (High Value + Low Feasibility):
Invest carefully—high value but requires significant effort
•
•

MAYBE LATER (Low Value + High Feasibility):
Consider if resources allow—easy wins but limited impact
•
•

AVOID (Low Value + Low Feasibility):
Don't pursue—not worth the effort

## Part 5: Portfolio Construction (10 minutes)

### Assign Investment Horizons

Categorize each initiative you're considering:

```
HORIZON ASSIGNMENT

HORIZON 1 - OPTIMIZE (0-6 months)
Proven patterns, immediate value, builds credibility
•
•
•
•

HORIZON 2 - EXTEND (6-18 months)
Emerging patterns, moderate risk, significant capability
•
•

HORIZON 3 - TRANSFORM (18+ months)

## Deliverable

Create a complete Portfolio Prioritization Package:

1. **Scored Opportunity Inventory** (Parts 2-3)
   - All 12 initiatives scored on value and feasibility
   - Quantified value for top opportunities

2. **Prioritization Matrix** (Part 4)
   - Visual placement of all initiatives
   - Quadrant assignments with rationale

3. **Portfolio Allocation** (Part 5)
   - Budget and resource allocation
   - Horizon balance validation

4. **Investment Roadmap** (Part 6)
   - Quarterly timeline with milestones
   - Success metrics

---

## Extension Challenge

**Defend the Portfolio**

Prepare to present your portfolio to the CEO with:

1. A one-page executive summary explaining the portfolio strategy
2. Clear rationale for what was excluded and why
3. Risk mitigation plan for the "Big Bets"
4. Dependencies and assumptions documented
5. Decision points where you might adjust the portfolio

Practice presenting to an AI assistant playing "skeptical CEO" who asks:
- "Why aren't we doing more AI? Competitors are moving fast."
- "This seems conservative. Where's the innovation?"
- "How do you know these estimates are accurate?"
- "What if we cut the budget by 30%?"
