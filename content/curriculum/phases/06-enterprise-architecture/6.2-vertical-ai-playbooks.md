# Vertical AI Playbooks

## WHY This Matters

Generic AI strategies fail. Every industry has unique:

- Customer behaviors and expectations
- Regulatory constraints
- System landscapes
- Competitive dynamics
- Value chain positions

The enterprise architects who succeed don't apply one-size-fits-all AI playbooks. They develop vertical-specific strategies that account for industry realities.

In this module, we'll use retail and commerce as our vertical—but the frameworks apply to any industry.

## WHAT You Need to Know

### The Agentic Commerce Stack

:::concept[agentic-stack]
Before building a vertical playbook, understand the technology layers:

Each layer has specific design considerations for your vertical.

### Emerging Commerce Protocols

Three major protocols are shaping agentic commerce:

| Protocol | Provider | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **ACP** (Agentic Commerce Protocol) | OpenAI | Enables ChatGPT to browse and purchase on behalf of customers |
| **AP2** (Agent Payments Protocol) | Google | Lets Gemini make purchases with user-defined "mandates" |
| **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) | Anthropic | The "USB port" connecting LLMs to enterprise systems |

**Strategic implication**: Retailers who implement these protocols become discoverable by AI shopping assistants. Those who don't become invisible.

### The Retail AI Opportunity Map

:::concept[retail-opportunity-map]
AI opportunities in retail cluster into five domains:

**1. Discovery & Recommendation**
- Conversational product search
- Personalized recommendations
- Visual search and style matching
- Gift recommendation assistants

**2. Customer Service**
- Order inquiry handling
- Return/exchange processing
- Product question answering
- Complaint resolution

**3. Operations & Supply Chain**
- Demand forecasting
- Inventory optimization
- Supplier communication
- Logistics coordination

**4. Merchandising**
- Price optimization
- Assortment planning
- Promotion effectiveness
- Competitive analysis

**5. Content & Marketing**
- Product description generation
- Marketing copy creation
- Review analysis and insights
- Personalized email content
:::

### The Retail System Landscape

Understanding key systems is essential for integration planning:

| System | Full Name | Role in AI Strategy |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| **PIM** | Product Information Management | Source of truth for product data AI agents reference |
| **CDP** | Customer Data Platform | Provides customer context for personalization |
| **OMS** | Order Management System | Enables agents to check orders, process returns |
| **ATP** | Available to Promise | Real-time inventory data for accurate availability |
| **CMS** | Content Management System | Houses editorial content AI agents cite |

**Critical insight**: AI agents are only as good as the data they access. Poor PIM data = poor recommendations. Outdated inventory = broken promises.

### Building the Vertical Playbook

A complete vertical playbook addresses:

**1. Opportunity Assessment**
- Which AI use cases align with vertical dynamics?
- Where are the highest-value opportunities?
- What are the vertical-specific risks?

**2. Data Readiness**
- What data is needed for priority use cases?
- Is the data quality sufficient?
- What integrations are required?

**3. System Architecture**
- How will AI agents connect to existing systems?
- What new infrastructure is needed?
- How will real-time data be provided?

**4. Regulatory Considerations**
- What vertical-specific regulations apply?
- How do AI governance requirements differ?
- What compliance controls are needed?

**5. Competitive Dynamics**
- Who are the AI leaders in this vertical?
- What capabilities are becoming table stakes?
- Where can differentiation be achieved?

### Retail-Specific Considerations

**Product information quality matters enormously:**
- AI agents cite what's in your PIM
- Incomplete specs = lost recommendations
- Inaccurate data = customer complaints

**Real-time data is critical:**
- "Is this in stock?" requires live ATP
- Price changes must propagate immediately
- Promotion eligibility must be accurate

**Customer context enables personalization:**
- Previous purchases inform recommendations
- Loyalty status affects offers
- Browse history guides suggestions

**Guardrails prevent brand damage:**
- Agents must not recommend competitors
- Pricing errors must be caught
- Returns policy must be accurate

### The Agentic Commerce Readiness Assessment

| Dimension | Low Readiness | Medium Readiness | High Readiness |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Product Data** | Incomplete, inconsistent | Mostly complete, some gaps | Comprehensive, structured |
| **Inventory Data** | Batch updates | Near-real-time | True real-time ATP |
| **Customer Data** | Siloed systems | Partially unified | Full CDP integration |
| **API Infrastructure** | Limited, legacy | Modern APIs, some gaps | Comprehensive, documented |
| **Content Authority** | Thin, generic | Some expert content | Authoritative, cited |

## HOW to Apply This

### Exercise: Build a Retail AI Playbook

:::exercise[vertical-playbook]
**Create a vertical AI playbook for a specialty retailer:**

**Scenario:**
You're the enterprise architect for a specialty outdoor gear retailer:
- 120 stores, strong e-commerce (40% of revenue)
- Loyal customer base, premium positioning
- Extensive product knowledge requirements
- Seasonal demand patterns

**Part 1: Opportunity Assessment**

Rank these opportunities for your vertical (1=highest priority):

| Opportunity | Priority (1-5) | Why? |
|-------------|:--------------:|------|
| Conversational product advisor | | |
| Customer service automation | | |
| Demand forecasting | | |
| Product description generation | | |
| Review analysis for merchandising | | |

**Part 2: Data Readiness Assessment**

For your top 2 opportunities, assess:

```
OPPORTUNITY 1: _________________________

Required Data:
• _________________________
• _________________________
• _________________________

Current Quality (1-5): ___
Gap Description:
_________________________________________

Integration Required:
• _________________________
• _________________________
```

**Part 3: Architecture Sketch**

For your top opportunity, outline:
