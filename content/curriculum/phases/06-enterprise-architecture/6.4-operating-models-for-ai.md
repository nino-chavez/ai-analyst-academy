# Operating Models for AI

## WHY This Matters

Individual AI projects can succeed with ad-hoc approaches. AI at scale cannot.

When AI moves from pilots to production, from one team to many, organizations need:

- Clear ownership and accountability
- Consistent standards and practices
- Efficient resource allocation
- Systematic learning and improvement
- Appropriate risk management

The operating model is what makes AI scalable, sustainable, and safe. Without it, you get fragmented efforts, duplicated work, inconsistent quality, and ungovernable risk.

## WHAT You Need to Know

### Operating Model Components

:::concept[operating-model]
A complete AI operating model addresses five dimensions:

**1. Organizational Structure**
- Where does AI capability live?
- Who owns what?
- How do teams coordinate?

**2. Governance & Decision Rights**
- Who approves AI initiatives?
- Who sets standards?
- Who manages risk?

**3. Talent & Skills**
- What roles are needed?
- How is talent developed?
- Where is expertise centralized vs. distributed?

**4. Processes & Practices**
- How are AI projects delivered?
- How is quality assured?
- How is knowledge shared?

**5. Technology & Platforms**
- What infrastructure is shared?
- What tools are standard?
- How is data managed?
:::

### The Organizational Models

Three primary patterns for organizing AI capability:

**Model 1: Centralized (Center of Excellence)**

  <img src="/diagrams/org-model-centralized.svg" alt="Centralized AI CoE model where all AI talent and work flows through a central team to business units" loading="lazy" />
</figure>

**Model 2: Federated (Hub and Spoke)**

<figure class="diagram">
  <img src="/diagrams/org-model-federated.svg" alt="Federated AI model where each business unit has its own AI team with loose coordination" loading="lazy" />
</figure>

**Model 3: Hybrid (Matrix)** *(Recommended)*

<figure class="diagram">
  <img src="/diagrams/org-model-hybrid.svg" alt="Hybrid AI model combining a central CoE for standards and expertise with embedded AI talent in each business unit" loading="lazy" />
</figure>

### Choosing the Right Model

| Factor | Favors Centralized | Favors Federated | Favors Hybrid |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|
| AI maturity | Low | Medium-High | Medium |
| Org size | Small-Medium | Large | Medium-Large |
| BU diversity | Low | High | Medium |
| Talent availability | Scarce | Available | Mixed |
| Regulation intensity | High | Low | Medium |

### The Center of Excellence Model

For most enterprises starting their AI journey, a CoE is the right foundation:

:::concept[coe-functions]
**Core CoE Functions:**

**1. Standards & Governance**
- Define AI policies and guidelines
- Set quality and risk standards
- Manage compliance requirements

**2. Platform & Tools**
- Provide shared AI infrastructure
- Standardize tool selection
- Manage vendor relationships

**3. Expertise & Consulting**
- Provide specialized AI skills
- Consult on complex initiatives
- Solve cross-cutting problems

**4. Enablement & Training**
- Build organizational AI literacy
- Develop power users
- Create learning resources

**5. Innovation & Research**
- Explore emerging capabilities
- Run Horizon 3 experiments
- Curate external learning

### Governance Design

| Decision Type | Who Decides | Who Advises | Who Executes |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| AI strategy & vision | Executive sponsor | CoE, BU leaders | CoE |
| Investment allocation | Steering committee | CoE, Finance | BU leaders |
| Standards & policies | CoE | Legal, Security, Risk | CoE |
| Use case approval | Tiered (see below) | CoE, Risk | BU teams |
| Vendor selection | IT + CoE | Procurement | CoE |
| Incident response | CoE + Risk | Legal | Response team |

**Tiered Use Case Approval:**

| Tier | Risk Level | Approver | Review Requirements |
|------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | Low (internal, non-critical) | Manager | Self-assessment |
| 2 | Medium (customer-facing, review) | CoE | CoE review |
| 3 | High (autonomous, sensitive) | Steering committee | Full governance review |

### Scaling Patterns

As AI matures, the operating model evolves:

**Stage 1: Seed (0-6 months)**
- Small core team (2-4 people)
- Focus on first pilots
- Establish initial standards
- Prove value

**Stage 2: Grow (6-18 months)**
- Formal CoE structure
- First production deployments
- Training programs launched
- Governance established

**Stage 3: Scale (18-36 months)**
- Federated teams emerge
- Self-service capabilities
- Mature governance
- Measured value delivery

**Stage 4: Pervasive (36+ months)**
- AI embedded everywhere
- CoE becomes strategic advisor
- Continuous improvement
- Industry leadership

### Critical Success Factors

| Factor | Description | Warning Signs |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Executive sponsorship** | Active, visible support from C-suite | AI buried in IT, no strategic priority |
| **Clear ownership** | Unambiguous accountability | "Everyone's responsibility" = nobody's |
| **Funding model** | Sustainable investment approach | Project-by-project begging |
| **Talent strategy** | Build, buy, borrow plan | Always short on skills |
| **Change management** | Systematic adoption approach | Tech deployed, nobody uses it |
