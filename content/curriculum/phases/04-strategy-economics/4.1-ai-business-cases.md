# Building AI Business Cases

## WHY This Matters

AI projects compete for resources with every other initiative in your organization. Without a compelling business case:

- Great ideas don't get funded
- Successful pilots don't scale
- AI becomes a "science project" rather than business tool
- You can't measure success or course-correct

The operators who can translate AI capabilities into business outcomes lead the transformation.

## WHAT You Need to Know

### The AI Value Framework

:::concept[ai-value]
AI creates value through multiple channels:

**Cost reduction:**
- Labor hours saved
- Error reduction
- Process efficiency
- Resource optimization

**Revenue enhancement:**
- Faster time to market
- Better customer experience
- New product capabilities
- Increased capacity

**Risk mitigation:**
- Improved compliance
- Better decision-making
- Earlier problem detection
- Reduced human error

**Strategic positioning:**
- Competitive advantage
- Capability building
- Market differentiation
- Future readiness
:::

### ROI Calculation

**Basic ROI formula:**
```
ROI = (Value Generated - Total Cost) / Total Cost × 100
```

**AI-specific considerations:**

| Value Component | How to Measure |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Time saved | Hours × hourly rate |
| Quality improvement | Error rate reduction × cost per error |
| Speed improvement | Faster cycle × value of time |
| Scale achieved | Volume increase × marginal value |
| Innovation | New capability value (harder to quantify) |

| Cost Component | What to Include |
|----------------|-----------------|
| AI costs | API fees, subscriptions, compute |
| Development | Build time, integration work |
| Training | User education, change management |
| Maintenance | Ongoing monitoring, updates |
| Risk buffer | Unexpected issues (15-25% typical) |

### Building the Business Case

**Structure:**

```
1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
   └─> One-page overview: problem, solution, ROI, ask

2. CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS
   ├─> Process description
   ├─> Pain points and costs
   ├─> Performance metrics
   └─> Competitive context

3. PROPOSED SOLUTION
   ├─> AI approach
   ├─> How it works
   ├─> Technical requirements
   └─> Implementation plan

4. VALUE ANALYSIS
   ├─> Quantified benefits
   ├─> Qualitative benefits
   ├─> ROI calculation
   └─> Payback period

5. RISKS AND MITIGATION
   ├─> Technical risks
   ├─> Operational risks
   ├─> Financial risks
   └─> Mitigation strategies

6. RECOMMENDATION
   ├─> Investment request
   ├─> Timeline
   ├─> Success metrics
   └─> Decision points
```

### Value Driver Analysis

:::concept[value-drivers]
**Value drivers** are the specific mechanisms through which AI creates business value. Identify and quantify each:

**Efficiency drivers:**
- Task completion time reduction
- Multi-tasking capability (AI works 24/7)
- Batch processing vs. sequential
- Reduced context-switching

**Quality drivers:**
- Consistency (same approach every time)
- Completeness (doesn't forget steps)
- Accuracy (pattern recognition)
- Compliance (follows rules)

**Scale drivers:**
- Handle volume spikes
- Expand capacity without hiring
- Serve more customers
- Process more data
:::

### The Comparison Trap

Don't just compare AI to doing nothing. Compare to alternatives:

| Alternative | Fair Comparison |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Do nothing | Value of status quo problems |
| Hire more people | Full cost (salary, benefits, training, management) |
| Outsource | Vendor costs + coordination overhead |
| Different technology | Full implementation and maintenance cost |
| Process improvement | Realistic improvement potential |

## HOW to Apply This

### Exercise: Build a Business Case

:::exercise[business-case]
**Scenario**: You want to implement an AI assistant to help your customer service team handle initial customer inquiries.

**Current state:**
- 10 support agents handling 500 tickets/day
- Average handle time: 15 minutes
- Customer satisfaction: 75%
- First response time: 4 hours
- Agent salary: $50,000/year

**AI solution proposal:**
- AI handles 40% of tickets autonomously
- Reduces handle time by 30% for agent-assisted tickets
- Implementation cost: $50,000
- Ongoing cost: $2,000/month

**Build the business case:**

1. **Calculate current costs:**
   - Total labor cost
   - Cost per ticket

2. **Project future state:**
   - Tickets handled by AI
   - Tickets handled by humans (faster)
   - New cost structure

3. **Quantify benefits:**
   - Direct cost savings
   - Capacity increase
   - Satisfaction improvement potential

4. **Calculate ROI:**
   - Year 1 ROI
   - Payback period
   - 3-year projection

5. **Identify risks:**
   - What could go wrong?
   - How would you mitigate?

```
AI BUSINESS CASE: [Initiative Name]

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Investment: $[X]
Annual Value: $[Y]
ROI: [Z]%
Payback: [N] months

THE OPPORTUNITY
- Current process: [Description]
- Problem: [Pain points]
- Impact: [Cost/scale of problem]

THE SOLUTION
- Approach: [AI implementation]
- How it works: [Brief description]
- Implementation: [Timeline]

VALUE ANALYSIS
| Benefit | Annual Value | Calculation |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| [Benefit 1] | $[X] | [How calculated] |
| [Benefit 2] | $[Y] | [How calculated] |
| Total | $[Z] | |

| Cost | Investment | Ongoing/Year |
|------|------------|--------------|
| [Cost 1] | $[X] | $[Y] |
| [Cost 2] | $[X] | $[Y] |
| Total | $[X] | $[Y] |

```

### Common Business Case Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Correction |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Only counting savings | Misses revenue and strategic value | Include all value types |
| Ignoring hidden costs | Underestimates investment | Include training, maintenance |
| Over-promising | Destroys credibility | Be conservative, then exceed |
| No comparison baseline | Can't prove value | Measure before implementing |
| Vague benefits | Not actionable | Quantify everything possible |
