# Risk and Governance

## WHY This Matters

AI can create significant value—but also significant risk. Organizations deploying AI face:

- **Legal liability** from AI mistakes
- **Reputational damage** from AI failures
- **Regulatory scrutiny** as AI laws emerge
- **Ethical concerns** from stakeholders
- **Operational risks** from AI dependencies

AI operators need to understand risk management, not just AI capabilities.

## WHAT You Need to Know

### The AI Risk Landscape

:::concept[ai-risks]
AI risks fall into several categories:

**Technical risks:**
- Model errors and hallucinations
- Training data bias
- Performance degradation
- Security vulnerabilities

**Operational risks:**
- Over-dependence on AI
- Loss of human expertise
- Vendor lock-in
- Cost overruns

**Legal/regulatory risks:**
- Data privacy violations
- Intellectual property issues
- Discrimination claims
- Regulatory non-compliance

**Reputational risks:**
- Public AI failures
- Perceived job losses
- Ethical controversies
- Customer distrust
:::

### Risk Assessment Framework

| Risk | Likelihood (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Score | Priority |
|------|------------------|--------------|-------|----------|
| [Risk name] | | | L × I | H/M/L |

**Likelihood factors:**
- How often could this happen?
- What's the exposure surface?
- What controls exist?

**Impact factors:**
- Financial cost if it occurs
- Reputational damage
- Operational disruption
- Legal/regulatory consequences

### AI Governance Framework

:::concept[ai-governance]
**AI governance** is the system of rules, practices, and processes that guide how AI is developed, deployed, and monitored within an organization.

**Key components:**
- **Policies**: What's allowed, what's not
- **Processes**: How AI projects are approved and monitored
- **Roles**: Who's responsible for what
- **Controls**: Technical and procedural safeguards
- **Oversight**: How compliance is verified
:::

**Governance structure:**

```
AI GOVERNANCE HIERARCHY

Executive Oversight
├── AI Ethics Board / Committee
│   └── Policy decisions, ethical review
│
├── AI Center of Excellence
│   └── Standards, best practices, support
│
├── Business Unit Leaders
│   └── Use case prioritization, ownership
│
└── AI Operators / Users
    └── Responsible use, issue escalation
```

### AI Use Policy Elements

| Policy Area | What to Define |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Approved uses** | What AI can be used for |
| **Prohibited uses** | What's off-limits |
| **Data handling** | What data can/can't go into AI |
| **Human oversight** | When human review required |
| **Quality standards** | Minimum acceptable quality |
| **Documentation** | What must be recorded |
| **Incident response** | How to handle AI failures |

### Responsible AI Principles

| Principle | What It Means | How to Implement |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| **Transparency** | Users know they're interacting with AI | Disclosure, explainability |
| **Fairness** | AI doesn't discriminate | Bias testing, diverse data |
| **Accountability** | Someone owns outcomes | Clear responsibility chain |
| **Privacy** | Personal data protected | Data minimization, anonymization |
| **Safety** | AI doesn't cause harm | Testing, monitoring, kill switches |
| **Human control** | Humans can override AI | Escalation paths, overrides |

### Regulatory Landscape

:::concept[ai-regulation]
AI regulation is evolving rapidly:

**Current/emerging regulations:**
- **EU AI Act**: Risk-based regulation of AI systems
- **GDPR/CCPA**: Data protection affecting AI training
- **Industry-specific**: Financial services, healthcare, HR
- **Employment law**: AI in hiring decisions
- **Consumer protection**: AI in customer interactions

**Compliance considerations:**
- Where are your users/data located?
- What industry regulations apply?
- What AI use cases have special requirements?
- How will regulation likely evolve?

## HOW to Apply This

### Exercise: Create a Governance Framework

:::exercise[governance-framework]
**Scenario**: Your organization is seeing rapid, uncoordinated AI adoption. Different teams are using various AI tools with no central oversight. You've been asked to propose a governance framework.

**Build a basic framework:**

**1. Risk assessment:**
Identify the top 5 risks of uncontrolled AI adoption in your organization.

**2. Policy recommendations:**
Draft 5-7 key policy statements (e.g., "All AI-generated customer communications must be reviewed by a human before sending").

**3. Roles and responsibilities:**
Who should be responsible for:
- Setting AI policy?
- Approving new AI use cases?
- Monitoring AI performance?
- Handling AI incidents?

**4. Process design:**
How should a new AI use case be proposed, evaluated, and approved?

**5. Controls:**
What technical or procedural controls would reduce the risks you identified?

### Governance Maturity Levels

| Level | Characteristics | Typical Organization |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **1: Ad Hoc** | No formal governance, individual decisions | Early AI adopters |
| **2: Emerging** | Some policies, inconsistent enforcement | Growing awareness |
| **3: Defined** | Clear policies, assigned responsibilities | Maturing programs |
| **4: Managed** | Systematic monitoring, metrics-driven | Sophisticated users |
| **5: Optimizing** | Continuous improvement, leading practice | AI-mature organizations |

### AI Incident Response Checklist

When an AI system causes problems:

| Step | Actions |
|------|---------|
| **1. Contain** | Stop the AI system if necessary |
| **2. Assess** | Understand what happened and impact |
| **3. Communicate** | Notify affected parties |
| **4. Investigate** | Root cause analysis |
| **5. Remediate** | Fix the immediate problem |
| **6. Prevent** | Address systemic issues |
| **7. Document** | Record lessons learned |
