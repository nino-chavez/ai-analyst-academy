# Selling AI to Skeptics

## WHY This Matters

Every AI initiative faces skeptics. And they're not wrong to be skeptical:

- 85% of AI projects fail to deliver business value
- Most organizations have seen "innovation theater" before
- AI feels threatening to people whose work might change
- The technology is genuinely uncertain and evolving

The operators who transform organizations aren't the ones with the best technical skills—they're the ones who can bring skeptics along. You need to sell the vision without overselling the technology.

## WHAT You Need to Know

### The Skeptic Taxonomy

:::concept[skeptic-types]
Not all resistance is the same. Different skeptics require different approaches:

**The Risk-Averse Leader**
- Concern: "What if this goes wrong?"
- Motivation: Protecting their reputation and team
- Approach: Lead with risk mitigation, not upside

**The Burned Veteran**
- Concern: "We tried this before. It failed."
- Motivation: Not wanting to repeat past pain
- Approach: Acknowledge past failures, explain what's different

**The Budget Guardian**
- Concern: "How much will this cost and for how long?"
- Motivation: Protecting resources, managing optics
- Approach: Clear ROI, phased investment, quick wins

**The Threatened Expert**
- Concern: "Is this replacing me/my team?"
- Motivation: Job security, professional identity
- Approach: Augmentation narrative, new opportunities

**The Technical Purist**
- Concern: "The technology isn't mature enough."
- Motivation: Technical standards, avoiding shortcuts
- Approach: Acknowledge limitations, focus on bounded use cases
:::

### The Objection Playbook

Every AI pitch surfaces predictable objections. Prepare for them:

| Objection | Weak Response | Strong Response |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| "AI makes stuff up" | "We'll prompt carefully" | "You're right. That's why we'll use AI for X where hallucination risk is manageable, not for Y where it's critical" |
| "It's too expensive" | "But look at these savings!" | "Let me show the 90-day pilot cost vs. the cost of not solving this problem" |
| "We don't have the data" | "We can start with what we have" | "We don't need perfect data—we need enough data to prove the concept, then iterate" |
| "Compliance won't allow it" | "Other companies are doing it" | "Here's how we'd work with legal and compliance from day one—they're part of the pilot team" |
| "What about security?" | "These tools are enterprise-grade" | "Valid concern. Here's our security review process and the specific controls we'll implement" |

### The Risk Paradox

Here's the insight most operators miss:

**Skeptics think about risk asymmetrically:**
- Risk of doing something new (very salient)
- Risk of doing nothing (often invisible)

Your job is to make the **status quo risk visible**.

:::concept[status-quo-risk]
**Frame the choice correctly:**

Not: "Should we try AI?"
But: "Which risk do we accept?"

| Option | Risk |
|--------|------|
| Try AI | Pilot fails, we learn, iterate |
| Do nothing | Competitors gain 18 months of learning while we wait |

Every month you don't learn is competitive debt you're accumulating.

### The Pilot Pitch Pattern

The most effective way to move skeptics: **propose a bounded pilot**.

<figure class="diagram">
  <img src="/diagrams/90-day-pilot-timeline.svg" alt="90-Day AI Pilot Timeline showing three phases: Foundation (weeks 1-4), Expansion (weeks 5-8), and Optimization (weeks 9-12)" loading="lazy" />
  <figcaption>The 90-Day Pilot Timeline: Foundation → Expansion → Optimization</figcaption>
</figure>

**Why this works:**

1. **Bounded risk**: 90 days, small team, limited scope
2. **Clear decision point**: Built-in evaluation moment
3. **Permission to fail**: "Pivot or stop" is an acceptable outcome
4. **Data over opinions**: Metrics settle debates

### Quick Wins Strategy

Skeptics need to see results before they believe. Choose initial use cases that:

| Criterion | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| High visibility | Stakeholders notice the impact |
| Low risk | Failure won't be catastrophic |
| Short cycle | Results visible in weeks, not months |
| Measurable | Clear before/after comparison |
| Volunteer participants | Early adopters, not conscripts |

**Good first pilots:**
- Internal document search/Q&A
- Meeting summarization
- First-draft content generation
- Data formatting/transformation
- Customer inquiry triage

**Bad first pilots:**
- Customer-facing production systems
- High-stakes decision automation
- Anything requiring perfect accuracy
- Complex integrations

### The Influence Map

Before pitching, map your stakeholders:

<figure class="diagram">
  <img src="/diagrams/influence-map.svg" alt="Stakeholder Influence Map showing four quadrants: Key Players (high power, high interest), Keep Satisfied (high power, low interest), Keep Informed (low power, high interest), and Monitor (low power, low interest)" loading="lazy" />
  <figcaption>Stakeholder Influence Map: Map your stakeholders before pitching</figcaption>
</figure>

| Quadrant | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| High Power / High Interest | **Partner**: Deep involvement, co-design the pilot |
| High Power / Low Interest | **Manage Closely**: Regular updates, no surprises |
| Low Power / High Interest | **Keep Informed**: Share progress, recruit as champions |
| Low Power / Low Interest | **Keep Satisfied**: Light touch, occasional updates |

## HOW to Apply This

### Exercise: Craft Your Pitch

:::exercise[skeptic-pitch]
**Scenario**: You want to implement an AI assistant to help your team summarize customer feedback from support tickets and identify trending issues.

**The skeptic**: Your VP of Customer Success is concerned about:
- "What if we miss critical issues because AI summarized them wrong?"
- "My team is already stretched thin—they can't learn new tools"
- "We tried a chatbot two years ago and it was a disaster"

**Build your pitch:**

1. **Acknowledge the concern** (don't dismiss):
   - What specifically would you say to validate their past experience?

2. **Reframe the risk**:
   - What is the cost of the current process?
   - What are they missing without better synthesis?

3. **Propose a bounded pilot**:
   - Scope: Which subset of tickets?
   - Duration: How long?
   - Participants: Who?
   - Success metrics: What would prove value?

4. **Address the "different this time" question**:
   - What has changed since their chatbot failure?
   - Why is this use case different?

5. **Offer an exit ramp**:
   - What's the kill criteria?
   - How will they know to stop if it's not working?

### Common Selling Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Correction |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Leading with technology | Skeptics don't care about AI—they care about outcomes | Lead with the problem and business value |
| Overselling capabilities | Destroys credibility when limitations emerge | Be honest about what AI can and cannot do |
| Ignoring past failures | Feels dismissive, breeds resentment | Acknowledge past pain, explain what's different |
| Asking for too much | Big asks get rejected | Start small, prove value, expand |
| Skipping the pilot | No evidence to support claims | Always propose bounded experiments |
| Underestimating politics | Ignoring stakeholder dynamics | Map influence, build coalitions |
