# Stakeholder Communication

## WHY This Matters

AI projects generate more stakeholder anxiety than traditional projects:

- The technology is unfamiliar
- Timelines feel uncertain
- Results are harder to predict
- Risks feel more existential

Poor communication doesn't just annoy stakeholders—it kills projects. Good communication doesn't just inform—it builds the trust that lets you navigate inevitable setbacks.

## WHAT You Need to Know

### The Communication Cadence

:::concept[communication-cadence]
Different stakeholders need different frequencies and depths:

**Executive Sponsors (Monthly)**
- Strategic progress vs. milestones
- Budget and resource status
- Key decisions needed
- Risks that need attention
- Format: 5-minute verbal + 1-page summary

**Steering Committee (Bi-weekly)**
- Phase progress
- Metrics and trends
- Issues and mitigations
- Upcoming decisions
- Format: 30-minute meeting + dashboard

**Working Team (Weekly)**
- Task-level progress
- Blockers and help needed
- Technical decisions
- Next week's priorities
- Format: 15-minute standup + async updates

**Stakeholders Affected by Change (As needed)**
- What's changing and when
- How they're affected
- Training and support available
- Who to contact with questions
- Format: Targeted updates, Q&A sessions
:::

### The Status Report Structure

Every status update should answer five questions:

```
AI PROJECT STATUS: [Date]

1. ARE WE ON TRACK?
   Status: 🟢 On Track | 🟡 At Risk | 🔴 Off Track

2. WHAT DID WE ACCOMPLISH?
   - [Milestone/deliverable completed]
   - [Metric achieved]

3. WHAT'S NEXT?
   - [Next milestone]
   - [Key activities this period]

4. WHAT'S IN THE WAY?
   - [Blocker/risk]: [Impact] → [Mitigation]

5. WHAT DO WE NEED?
   - [Decision needed from whom by when]
   - [Resource or access needed]
```

### Executive Communication

Executives have limited time and need different information than project teams:

| Executives Care About | Executives Don't Care About |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Business outcomes | Technical details |
| Money and timeline | Individual task status |
| Strategic risks | Tactical issues |
| Decisions they need to make | Decisions you already made |
| What's different from the plan | Everything going as expected |

**The 2-minute executive update:**

1. **Status in one sentence**: "We're on track/at risk/behind"
2. **Progress highlight**: "We completed [milestone] this week"
3. **Key metric**: "Accuracy is at 87%, target is 90%"
4. **Risk or blocker**: "We need [X] to stay on schedule"
5. **The ask**: "We need you to [decision/action]"

### Managing Expectations

AI projects are particularly prone to expectation gaps. Set expectations proactively:

**Before the project:**
- "AI will be good at X but not Y"
- "First version will handle 70% of cases, not 100%"
- "We'll learn as we go and adjust"
- "There will be edge cases that need human review"

**During the project:**
- Celebrate incremental wins, not just final delivery
- Report metrics honestly, including failures
- Surface problems early, before they're crises
- Distinguish between "behind schedule" and "learning"

**At milestones:**
- Demo real capabilities, not slide promises
- Show what doesn't work alongside what does
- Compare to baseline, not to perfection
- Discuss what we learned, not just what we built

### The Difficult Conversations

Every AI project eventually requires difficult conversations:

:::concept[difficult-conversations]
**"We're behind schedule"**
- Lead with the new timeline, not excuses
- Explain what caused the delay (briefly)
- Describe what you're doing to recover
- Ask for what you need (time, resources, scope reduction)
- Commit to the new timeline

**"The AI isn't performing as expected"**
- Present the data clearly
- Explain what "not performing" means specifically
- Propose options: more tuning, narrower scope, different approach
- Recommend a path forward
- Be honest about probability of success

**"We need more budget/time"**
- Quantify the ask precisely
- Explain what you get for the additional investment
- Present alternatives (scope reduction, quality trade-offs)
- Let them choose, but make recommendation clear
- Don't surprise them—early warning is essential

**"We should stop this project"**
- Present the evidence that led to this conclusion
- Frame stopping as learning, not failure
- Capture and share the lessons
- Propose what to do instead (if anything)
- Thank people for the investment
:::

### The Bad News Framework

When delivering bad news, use this structure:

```
THE BAD NEWS CONVERSATION

1. STATE THE SITUATION
   "I need to share some challenging news about [project]."

2. PRESENT THE FACTS
   "Here's what happened: [objective description]"

3. EXPLAIN THE IMPACT
   "This means: [timeline/budget/scope impact]"

4. TAKE OWNERSHIP
   "I take responsibility for [what you control]"

5. PRESENT OPTIONS
   "We have three paths forward:
   - Option A: [description + trade-offs]
   - Option B: [description + trade-offs]
   - Option C: [description + trade-offs]
   I recommend [X] because [reason]"

6. ASK FOR INPUT
   "What questions do you have?"
   "What am I missing?"

7. COMMIT TO NEXT STEPS
   "I'll [action] by [date] and update you by [date]"
```

### Stakeholder Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Correction |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| **Hiding bad news** | It always comes out, trust destroyed | Surface issues early |
| **Technical jargon** | Stakeholders tune out | Plain language, business focus |
| **Status inflation** | 🟢 until suddenly 🔴 | Honest, early warning |
| **Blame shifting** | Destroys relationships | Take ownership, focus on solutions |
| **Over-promising** | Credibility damage | Under-promise, over-deliver |
| **Infrequent updates** | Stakeholders fill silence with fear | Regular cadence, even if brief |
| **One-way communication** | Miss stakeholder concerns | Ask questions, seek feedback |

## HOW to Apply This

### Exercise: Craft Difficult Communications

:::exercise[stakeholder-comms]
**Scenario 1: The Delay**

Your AI project is 3 weeks behind the original 12-week timeline. The cause was unexpected data quality issues that required additional cleaning.

Write a 2-paragraph update to your executive sponsor that:
- Acknowledges the delay
- Explains (briefly) what happened
- Presents the new timeline
- Asks for what you need

---

**Scenario 2: The Performance Gap**

Your AI classification system is achieving 78% accuracy. The target was 90%. You're 6 weeks into an 8-week pilot.

Write talking points for a conversation with your steering committee:
- What are the options?
- What do you recommend?
- What's the ask?

---

**Scenario 3: The Stop Decision**

After 4 weeks of a pilot, it's clear the use case isn't viable. The AI can't reliably handle the edge cases that matter most, and users aren't adopting.

Write a memo recommending project termination:
- What's the evidence?
- What did we learn?
- What do we do next?
