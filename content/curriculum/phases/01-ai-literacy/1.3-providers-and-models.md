# Providers and Models

## WHY This Matters

The AI landscape is crowded and constantly evolving. Making the wrong model choice can mean:

- **Overpaying** for capabilities you don't need
- **Underperforming** with a model that can't handle your task
- **Vendor lock-in** that limits future flexibility
- **Compliance issues** with data handling requirements

Strategic AI operators build **provider-agnostic thinking**—understanding the landscape well enough to choose the right tool for each job.

## WHAT You Need to Know

### The Major Providers

| Provider | Flagship Model | Strengths | Considerations |
|----------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o | General excellence, multimodal, ecosystem | Premium pricing, occasional availability issues |
| **Anthropic** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Long context, safety focus, nuanced reasoning | Smaller ecosystem, no image generation |
| **Google** | Gemini 1.5 Pro | Massive context, multimodal, Google integration | Still maturing, variable quality |
| **Meta** | Llama 3 | Open source, self-hostable, customizable | Requires infrastructure, less refined |

### Capability Tiers

:::concept[model-tiers]
AI models typically come in tiers that trade off capability against cost and speed:

**Tier 1: Flagship Models**
- Highest capability
- Best for: Complex reasoning, nuanced writing, edge cases
- Examples: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro

**Tier 2: Balanced Models**
- Good capability at lower cost
- Best for: Standard tasks, high volume
- Examples: GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Gemini 1.5 Flash

**Tier 3: Speed/Cost Optimized**
- Fast and cheap
- Best for: Simple tasks, classification, extraction
- Examples: GPT-3.5 Turbo, specialized models

### Model Selection Framework

**Decision flowchart for model selection:**

```
START: What's the primary task?
│
├─► Complex reasoning/analysis
│   └─► Flagship model (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet)
│
├─► Standard generation/summarization
│   └─► Balanced model (GPT-4o-mini, Haiku)
│
├─► High-volume classification
│   └─► Speed-optimized or fine-tuned
│
├─► Long document processing
│   └─► Large context model (Claude, Gemini)
│
└─► Image understanding/generation
    └─► Multimodal (GPT-4o, Gemini) or specialized (DALL-E, Midjourney)
```

### Multi-Provider Architecture

:::concept[provider-abstraction]
**Provider abstraction** means designing your AI systems to work with multiple providers through a common interface. This provides:

- **Redundancy**: If one provider is down, switch to another
- **Cost optimization**: Route different tasks to optimal providers
- **Capability matching**: Use each provider's strengths
- **Future flexibility**: Easy to adopt new models
:::

**Example: Task-based routing**

| Task Type | Primary Provider | Fallback | Rationale |
|-----------|------------------|----------|-----------|
| Customer support | Claude | GPT-4o | Better at nuanced, empathetic responses |
| Data analysis | GPT-4o | Gemini | Strong structured output |
| Document summarization | Gemini | Claude | Handles long documents well |
| Code generation | Claude/GPT-4o | — | Both excellent, user preference |
| Simple classification | GPT-4o-mini | Haiku | Cost-effective for high volume |

### API Access and Authentication

All major providers use similar patterns:

```
API Key → Request (prompt + parameters) → Response (completion + metadata)
```

**Key parameters you control:**

| Parameter | What It Does | Typical Range |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| `temperature` | Creativity/randomness | 0 (deterministic) to 1 (creative) |
| `max_tokens` | Response length limit | 100-4000+ |
| `top_p` | Probability mass for token selection | 0.1-1.0 |
| `stop` | Stop generation at specific strings | Custom |

**Temperature guidance:**
- **0.0-0.3**: Factual, consistent (data extraction, classification)
- **0.4-0.6**: Balanced (general Q&A, summaries)
- **0.7-1.0**: Creative (brainstorming, creative writing)

## HOW to Apply This

### Exercise: Build a Provider Matrix

:::exercise[provider-matrix]
**Task**: Create a provider selection matrix for a marketing team that needs AI for:
1. Blog post generation (2-3 posts/week)
2. Social media copy (20+ posts/week)
3. Customer email responses (50+/day)
4. Competitive analysis reports (monthly)
5. Image generation for campaigns (10/week)

**For each use case, determine:**
- Primary model recommendation
- Fallback model
- Key parameters (temperature, max_tokens)
- Estimated monthly cost

**Constraints**:
- Monthly budget: $500
- Must maintain quality for client-facing content
- Need redundancy for customer emails (business critical)
:::

### Provider Comparison Checklist

When evaluating a new provider or model:

| Factor | Questions to Ask |
|--------|------------------|
| **Capability** | Does it handle your task type well? Benchmarks? |
| **Cost** | Price per token? Volume discounts? |
| **Latency** | Response time for your use case? |
| **Reliability** | Uptime history? Rate limits? |
| **Context** | Window size sufficient? |
| **Privacy** | Data retention policy? Training on inputs? |
| **Compliance** | SOC2? HIPAA? GDPR? |
| **Integration** | SDK quality? Documentation? |
