# Prompting as Management

## WHY This Matters

Most people treat AI like a search engine—ask a question, get an answer. But that's like hiring an employee and only asking them yes/no questions.

**The management mindset shift:**
- AI is a capable but literal-minded assistant
- Prompts are delegation, not commands
- Quality of output depends on quality of instruction
- You're responsible for the work product

When you start thinking of prompting as management, everything changes: your prompts become clearer, your results become better, and your AI spend becomes more efficient.

## WHAT You Need to Know

### The Delegation Framework

:::concept[delegation-framework]
Effective delegation to AI follows the same principles as delegating to humans—with some key adjustments:

**The CLEAR Framework:**
- **C**ontext: What background does the AI need?
- **L**oad: What specific task should be done?
- **E**xpectations: What does "good" look like?
- **A**udience: Who is this for?
- **R**estrictions: What should be avoided?
:::

**Example: Bad delegation vs. good delegation**

❌ **Bad**: "Write a marketing email"

✅ **Good**:
```
Context: We're launching a new project management tool for small teams (5-20 people). Our target audience is startup founders and team leads who currently use spreadsheets or basic tools.

Task: Write a launch announcement email.

Expectations:
- Tone: Professional but energetic
- Length: 150-200 words
- Include: One clear CTA (start free trial)
- Highlight: Time savings (average 5 hours/week)

Audience: Existing newsletter subscribers who signed up for product updates.

Restrictions:
- No hyperbole or superlatives ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
- Don't mention competitors by name
- No pricing in this email
```

### Chain of Thought Prompting

:::concept[chain-of-thought]
**Chain of thought (CoT)** prompting asks the AI to show its reasoning process, not just its conclusion. This dramatically improves accuracy for complex tasks.

**Why it works:**
- Forces systematic processing
- Makes errors visible and correctable
- Produces more reliable reasoning
- Enables you to verify the logic
:::

**CoT patterns:**

| Pattern | Trigger Phrase | Use Case |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **Basic CoT** | "Think step by step" | General problem-solving |
| **Structured CoT** | "First analyze X, then Y, finally Z" | Multi-stage analysis |
| **Verification CoT** | "Show your reasoning, then verify" | Critical calculations |
| **Contrasting CoT** | "Consider pros and cons before concluding" | Decision support |

**Example:**

Without CoT:
> "Should we expand into the Canadian market?"
> → Generic answer

With CoT:
> "Analyze whether we should expand into Canada. Think through:
> 1. Market size and growth potential
> 2. Regulatory/compliance requirements
> 3. Competition landscape
> 4. Logistical challenges
> 5. Resource requirements
>
> For each factor, assess and rate. Then provide a recommendation with confidence level."

### Persona Prompts

:::concept[persona-prompts]
**Persona prompts** give the AI a specific identity, expertise, and perspective to operate from. This focuses responses and creates consistency.

**Why personas work:**
- Activates relevant knowledge patterns
- Creates appropriate tone and vocabulary
- Establishes consistent perspective
- Makes outputs more contextually appropriate
:::

**Persona template:**

```
You are [NAME], a [ROLE] with [YEARS] of experience in [DOMAIN].

Your expertise includes:
- [Specific skill 1]
- [Specific skill 2]
- [Specific skill 3]

Your communication style:
- [Trait 1]
- [Trait 2]

You are helping [USER TYPE] with [GOAL].
```

**Example personas for business tasks:**

| Task | Persona | Why |
|------|---------|-----|
| Financial analysis | "CFO with 20 years in SaaS" | Focuses on metrics that matter |
| Customer complaint | "Senior support rep, empathy-focused" | Balances policy and compassion |
| Technical documentation | "Developer advocate who explains to non-technical audiences" | Accessible clarity |
| Strategy planning | "Management consultant from top-tier firm" | Structured, framework-driven |

### Iterative Refinement

Rarely is the first output perfect. Effective operators iterate:

**The refinement loop:**
1. **Generate**: Get initial output
2. **Evaluate**: Against your criteria
3. **Specify**: What needs to change
4. **Regenerate**: With refined prompt
5. **Repeat**: Until satisfactory

**Effective refinement prompts:**

| Issue | Refinement Prompt |
|-------|-------------------|
| Too long | "Condense to [X] words while preserving key points" |
| Too formal | "Rewrite in a more conversational tone" |
| Missing depth | "Expand on [specific section] with examples" |
| Wrong emphasis | "Restructure to lead with [topic]" |
| Incorrect facts | "The [X] is incorrect. It should be [Y]. Revise." |

## HOW to Apply This

### Exercise: Transform These Prompts

:::exercise[prompt-transformation]
**Transform each weak prompt into an effective delegation:**

1. **Weak**: "Write a report about our Q3 sales"
   → Apply CLEAR framework

2. **Weak**: "Should we hire more salespeople?"
   → Apply chain of thought

3. **Weak**: "Help me respond to this angry customer"
   → Apply persona prompts

**For each transformation:**
- Write the improved prompt
- Identify which techniques you used
- Explain why they'll improve the output
:::

### Prompt Quality Checklist

Before sending a prompt, verify:

| Element | Check |
|---------|-------|
| **Context** | Is necessary background included? |
| **Task** | Is the specific action crystal clear? |
| **Format** | Have I specified desired output structure? |
| **Constraints** | Are restrictions explicit? |
| **Quality criteria** | Does the AI know what "good" looks like? |
| **Examples** | Would a sample output help? (few-shot) |

### Self-Check
