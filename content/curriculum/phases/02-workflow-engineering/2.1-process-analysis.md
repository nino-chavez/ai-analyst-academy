# Process Analysis for AI Integration

## WHY This Matters

Before you can improve a workflow with AI, you need to understand it deeply. Most AI implementation failures come from:

- Automating the wrong tasks
- Ignoring upstream/downstream dependencies
- Underestimating human judgment requirements
- Missing the real bottlenecks

Process analysis reveals **where AI can add value** versus where it would add friction.

## WHAT You Need to Know

### The Process Mapping Framework

:::concept[process-mapping]
**Process mapping** creates a visual representation of how work flows through an organization. For AI integration, you need to capture:

- **Steps**: Each distinct action in the workflow
- **Inputs/Outputs**: What each step receives and produces
- **Decision points**: Where human judgment is required
- **Handoffs**: Where work transfers between people/systems
- **Time**: Duration of each step and wait times
- **Pain points**: Where problems commonly occur
:::

**Basic process documentation template:**

```
Step [N]: [Name]
├── Input: What triggers/feeds this step
├── Action: What happens
├── Output: What's produced
├── Owner: Who's responsible
├── Time: How long it takes
├── AI Potential: None / Assist / Automate
└── Notes: Pain points, dependencies, variations
```

### AI Opportunity Classification

Not all tasks are equal candidates for AI. Use this classification:

| Category | Characteristics | AI Role | Examples |
|----------|-----------------|---------|----------|
| **Automate** | Repetitive, rule-based, low judgment | Full automation | Data extraction, formatting, routing |
| **Assist** | Complex but structured, benefits from speed | Human + AI together | Drafting, analysis, suggestions |
| **Augment** | High judgment, benefits from information | AI provides inputs | Decision support, research, synthesis |
| **Avoid** | Relationship-critical, highly variable, risky | Keep human | Negotiations, crisis management, final approvals |

### The AI Suitability Scorecard

:::concept[ai-suitability]
Rate each process step on these dimensions to identify AI potential:

**High AI Suitability:**
- ✅ Repetitive (same task many times)
- ✅ Data-intensive (lots of information to process)
- ✅ Time-consuming for humans
- ✅ Quality inconsistent with manual effort
- ✅ Clear success criteria

**Low AI Suitability:**
- ❌ Requires physical presence
- ❌ Needs real-time human relationship
- ❌ High stakes with no verification possible
- ❌ Highly variable (every instance unique)
- ❌ Requires institutional memory/context AI can't access
:::

### Bottleneck Analysis

:::concept[bottleneck]
A **bottleneck** is any point where work accumulates faster than it can be processed. AI often has the most impact at bottlenecks—but only if the bottleneck is due to processing capacity, not other constraints.

**Bottleneck types:**
- **Capacity bottleneck**: Not enough people/time → AI can help
- **Skill bottleneck**: Need rare expertise → AI can help
- **Information bottleneck**: Waiting for data → Maybe AI can help
- **Approval bottleneck**: Waiting for decisions → Usually can't automate
- **Dependency bottleneck**: Waiting for others → Requires process change
:::

**Finding bottlenecks:**

| Signal | What to Look For |
|--------|------------------|
| Queue length | Where does work pile up? |
| Wait times | Where are the longest delays? |
| Overtime | Which steps require extra hours? |
| Complaints | Where do people express frustration? |
| Errors | Where do mistakes happen most? |
| Workarounds | Where have people created unofficial shortcuts? |

## HOW to Apply This

### Exercise: Map and Score a Process

:::exercise[process-mapping-exercise]
**Choose a workflow you're familiar with** (work process, personal routine, or hypothetical business scenario).

**Part 1: Map the process**
Document 5-10 steps using the template above.

**Part 2: Score AI suitability**
For each step, rate 1-5:
- Repetitiveness
- Data intensity
- Time consumption
- Quality variability
- Criteria clarity

**Part 3: Identify opportunities**
- Which steps score highest for AI?
- What type of AI integration? (Automate/Assist/Augment)
- Where are the bottlenecks?
- What dependencies might complicate AI integration?

**Example processes to analyze:**
- Customer onboarding
- Invoice processing
- Content creation pipeline
- Hiring workflow
- Customer support ticket handling

### Common Process Patterns and AI Potential

| Pattern | Description | AI Integration |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Intake & Triage** | Receiving items and routing them | High: Classification, extraction |
| **Research & Gather** | Collecting information | High: Search, summarization |
| **Draft & Create** | Producing content | High: Generation, templates |
| **Review & Approve** | Quality checking | Medium: Flagging, suggestions |
| **Communicate & Notify** | Sending updates | High: Personalization, scheduling |
| **Analyze & Report** | Making sense of data | High: Patterns, visualization |
| **Decide & Act** | Making choices | Low: Support only |

### Red Flags: When NOT to Automate

| Red Flag | Why It's Risky | Better Approach |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| "It depends" steps | Too much variability | Assist, don't automate |
| Customer emotions involved | Relationship risk | Human with AI support |
| Regulatory/legal review | Compliance risk | AI drafts, human approves |
| Steps that recently changed | Process not stable | Wait for stabilization |
| Steps no one understands | Can't verify AI output | Document first |
