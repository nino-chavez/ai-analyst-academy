# AI Analyst Academy — Academic Alignment

> **Verdict:** Highly appropriate for upper-division undergraduates (Junior/Senior) or MBA students.

This curriculum goes beyond "tool training" (vocational) and enters "systems thinking" (academic). It bridges the gap between **Theory** (what is AI?) and **Praxis** (how do I run a business with it?).

## Recommended Course Positioning

| Level | Course Title | Credits |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Undergraduate (Jr/Sr) | Operations Strategy in the AI Era | 3 |
| Undergraduate (Jr/Sr) | Applied Business Intelligence Capstone | 3 |
| MBA | Digital Transformation Core Module | 3 |

## Cognitive Depth (Bloom's Taxonomy)

A college course must move beyond **Understanding** to **Analyzing** and **Creating**. This curriculum achieves that progression:

| Lab / Topic | Cognitive Level | Academic Justification |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Lab 1: Persona Stress Test** | Evaluate | Students compare contrasting rhetorical strategies (Diplomat vs. Problem Solver) and analyze impact on brand reputation. Critical analysis of AI outputs. |
| **Lab 2: Chain of Thought Audit** | Analyze | Requires examining logical reasoning chains, identifying fallacies, and understanding how AI "thinks." Core Information Systems concept. |
| **Lab 3: Workflow Mapping** | Analyze | Diagramming complex operational dependencies and identifying bottlenecks—a core Operations Management skill. SOP translation. |
| **Lab 4: Quality Gate Design** | Create | Students design checkpoints and validation rules for AI workflows. Process engineering applied to AI. |
| **Lab 5: Build AI Assistant** | Apply | Hands-on chatbot building with defined system instructions. Applied prompt engineering. |
| **Lab 6: ROI Calculator** | Evaluate | Students build TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) models, defend assumptions, and perform sensitivity analysis. Standard Finance 301 material. |
| **Lab 7: Governance Framework** | Create | Synthesizes ethics, law, and risk management to draft organizational AI policy. |
| **Capstone** | Create | Full business case with policy design, synthesizing all prior learning. |

### Extended Labs (Complete)

Three additional labs provide 100% coverage of the "Business Operator" skill set:

| Lab | Title | Cognitive Level | Justification |
|-----|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Lab 3b** | Data Hygiene & Preparation | Apply | "Garbage In, Garbage Out" — forces students to confront data quality as prerequisite to AI success. |
| **Lab 5b** | Workflow Automation | Apply | Triggers and actions (Zapier/Make). Operators learn to chain AI between apps, not just build chatbots. |
| **Lab 7b** | Agentic Research: Trust but Verify | Evaluate | Audit agentic search tools for citation hallucinations. Critical thinking for autonomous AI. |

## Business School Competency Alignment

### Strategic Thinking (Labs 1, 6, Capstone)

**The Lesson:** "AI is not magic; it is a cost center that must prove value."

- Moves conversation from "Cool Tech" to "P&L Impact"
- ROI modeling, sensitivity analysis, business case development
- Aligns with: Strategy, Finance, Entrepreneurship courses

### Operations Management (Labs 3, 5)

**The Lesson:** "Automation requires standardized processes."

- Teaches Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and process optimization
- Lean/Six Sigma concepts applied to digital work
- Aligns with: Operations Management, Supply Chain, Process Engineering

### Information Systems & Data Literacy (Labs 2, 4)

**The Lesson:** "AI reasoning is fragile; clean data and logical chains are required."

- Introduces flow of unstructured data through systems
- Chain of thought analysis, data hygiene practices
- Aligns with: MIS (Management Information Systems), Business Analytics

### Ethics & Law (Lab 7, Capstone)

**The Lesson:** "Unchecked AI creates liability."

- Addresses "Responsible AI" requirements in accreditation standards
- Policy design, governance frameworks, risk management
- Aligns with: Business Ethics, Legal Environment, Risk Management

## Why It Fits the "Business Major" Persona

| Principle | How It's Applied |
|-----------|------------------|
| **No Code Required** | Focuses on logic and architecture, not syntax. Respects that Business students are not CS students. |
| **Deliverable-Based** | Each lab produces a professional artifact (Memo, ROI Spreadsheet, Policy Doc) mirroring consulting deliverables. |
| **Theory + Praxis** | Avoids being too technical (coding) or too fluffy ("future of work" talks). Bridges understanding and application. |
| **Progressive Complexity** | Phase 1 builds literacy → Phase 4 requires strategic synthesis. Matches semester-long learning arc. |

---

## Accreditation Considerations

Modern business school accreditation (AACSB, AMBA) increasingly requires:

1. **Digital/Technology Literacy** — Covered in Phases 1-3
2. **Ethical Reasoning** — Covered in Labs 6-7 and Capstone
3. **Experiential Learning** — All labs produce portfolio artifacts
4. **Cross-Functional Integration** — Curriculum spans Ops, Finance, Strategy, MIS

## Mapping to Standard Business Courses

| AI Analyst Academy | Traditional Course Equivalent |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Phase 1: AI Literacy | Introduction to Business Technology |
| Phase 2: Workflow Engineering | Operations Management |
| Phase 3: Agentic Orchestration | Management Information Systems / AI Systems |
| Phase 4: Strategy & Economics | Strategic Management / Finance |
| Labs 1-2 | Business Communication / Critical Thinking |
| Labs 3-5 | Process Analysis / Systems Integration |
| Labs 6-7 | Financial Analysis / Business Ethics |
| Capstone | Senior Capstone / Consulting Practicum |

## Content Development Implications

When writing or reviewing curriculum content, ensure:

1. **Cognitive progression** — Each module should advance up Bloom's taxonomy
2. **Business language** — Use terms familiar to business students (ROI, TCO, SOP, stakeholder)
3. **Professional artifacts** — Deliverables should resemble real consulting/corporate outputs
4. **No assumed coding knowledge** — Technical concepts explained through business analogies
5. **Ethical grounding** — Each phase should touch on responsibility, not just capability
