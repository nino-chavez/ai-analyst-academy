# AI Analyst Certification Framework

> **Version:** 1.0
> **Last Updated:** 2026-01-16

---

## Overview

The AI Analyst Certification is a **competency-based, portfolio-driven credential** that validates practical AI implementation skills. Unlike time-based certifications, this framework assesses what you can *do*, not how long you studied.

### Why Portfolio-Based?

Traditional certifications test knowledge retention. In AI implementation, what matters is:
- Can you build effective prompts for real business problems?
- Can you design AI workflows that actually work?
- Can you communicate AI value to skeptical stakeholders?
- Can you govern AI responsibly?

**A portfolio demonstrates capability. An exam tests memory.**

## Certification Tracks

The certification is structured into three progressive tracks:

| Track | Phases | Focus | Deliverables |
|-------|--------|-------|--------------|
| **Foundation** | 1-2 | AI literacy, workflow design | Prompt Library, Workflow Proposal |
| **Implementation** | 3-4 | Building and governing AI | AI Assistant, Strategy Presentation |
| **Leadership** | 5-6 | Leading AI initiatives | Initiative Proposal, Enterprise Roadmap |
| **Capstone** | All | Integrated demonstration | Complete AI Solution |

### Track Details

- [Foundation Track](./foundation-track.md) — Phases 1-2 criteria
- [Implementation Track](./implementation-track.md) — Phases 3-4 criteria

## Assessment Approach

### Rubric-Based Evaluation

Each deliverable is assessed against a 4-point rubric:

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 4 | Exemplary | Exceeds professional standards; could be used as a model |
| 3 | Proficient | Meets professional standards; ready for real-world use |
| 2 | Developing | Shows understanding but has gaps; needs refinement |
| 1 | Beginning | Fundamental gaps; requires significant revision |

**Minimum passing:** 3.0 average across all rubric criteria

### Self-Assessment First

Before submission, candidates complete a self-assessment:
1. Review deliverable against rubric
2. Identify strengths and weaknesses
3. Revise based on gaps found
4. Document any areas of uncertainty

**Why self-assessment?** Professionals must evaluate their own work. This skill is as important as the deliverable itself.

### Review Methods

**Current:**
- Self-assessment with rubric
- AI-assisted feedback (use Sandbox with evaluation prompts)

**Future:**
- Peer review exchange
- Expert review (premium)
- Automated portfolio analysis

## Portfolio Requirements

### Format

All deliverables should be:
- Professionally formatted (consistent styling)
- Well-organized (clear sections, logical flow)
- Free of errors (spelling, grammar, technical accuracy)
- Complete (all required sections present)

### Documentation Standards

Each deliverable must include:
1. **Problem Statement** — What business problem does this address?
2. **Approach** — What methodology did you use?
3. **Deliverable** — The actual work product
4. **Reflection** — What you learned, what you'd do differently

### Submission

Deliverables are stored in the platform's Portfolio section:
- `/portfolio` — Manage deliverables
- `/portfolio/prompts` — Prompt library management

---

## Maintaining Certification

### Validity Period

Certifications are valid for **2 years** from issue date.

### Renewal Options

1. **Continuing Education:** Complete advanced modules as they're released
2. **Portfolio Update:** Submit updated deliverables showing continued growth
3. **Re-assessment:** Complete current rubric assessment

### Why Renewal?

AI capabilities evolve rapidly. A 2022 certification based on GPT-3 patterns doesn't validate GPT-5 competence. Renewal ensures skills remain current.
