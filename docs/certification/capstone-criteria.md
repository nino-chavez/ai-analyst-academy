# Capstone Project Criteria

> **Track:** Capstone
> **Credential:** AI Analyst — Master
> **Prerequisite:** Leader Track

---

## Overview

The Capstone Project is your **integrated demonstration** of AI Analyst competencies. Unlike track deliverables that focus on specific skills, the Capstone requires you to synthesize everything: identify a real problem, design a solution, build a prototype, develop governance, and present to stakeholders.

**This is your portfolio centerpiece.**

---

## Project Requirements

### Core Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Original Problem** | A real business problem you've identified (not a lab scenario) |
| **End-to-End Solution** | From problem definition to working prototype |
| **Multi-Phase Integration** | Must draw on skills from all 6 phases |
| **Working Prototype** | Functional AI component (not just documentation) |
| **Governance Framework** | Risk and ethics consideration |
| **Stakeholder Materials** | Executive-ready presentation |

### Scope Guidelines

**Minimum scope:**
- Real business problem with quantifiable impact
- At least one functional AI component
- Complete implementation documentation
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Stakeholder presentation

**Maximum scope:**
- Don't try to transform an enterprise in your capstone
- Focus on a bounded, achievable demonstration
- Quality over breadth

## Project Components

### 1. Problem Definition (10% of assessment)

Document the business problem you're solving:

| Element | What to Include |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Problem Statement** | Clear, specific, quantified |

| **Functional AI** | Working AI component (not mocked) |
| **Core Workflow** | Primary use case works end-to-end |
| **User Interface** | Usable by someone other than you |
| **Testing Evidence** | Systematic testing with results |
| **Edge Cases** | How unusual inputs are handled |

**Rubric criteria:**
- Prototype actually works (demonstrate it)
- Solves the stated problem
- Could be extended to production with effort
- Quality of implementation (not just "it works")

---

### 4. Governance & Risk (15% of assessment)

Document your governance approach:

| Element | What to Include |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Risk Assessment** | What could go wrong, likelihood, impact |
| **Mitigation Strategies** | How you'll prevent or respond to risks |
| **Ethical Considerations** | Bias, fairness, privacy, transparency |
| **Operational Governance** | How this will be monitored and maintained |
| **Incident Response** | What happens when something goes wrong |

**Rubric criteria:**
- Risks are comprehensive (not just obvious ones)
- Mitigations are practical and actionable
- Ethical considerations are genuinely addressed
- Governance is proportionate to the solution

---

### 5. Business Case (15% of assessment)

Make the case for your solution:

| Element | What to Include |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Investment Required** | What it costs to build and run |
| **Value Generated** | Quantified benefits |
| **ROI Analysis** | Return calculation with assumptions |
| **Sensitivity Analysis** | What if assumptions are wrong |
| **Implementation Path** | How to go from prototype to production |

**Rubric criteria:**
- Numbers are realistic and well-sourced
- Assumptions are explicit and defensible
- ROI is compelling (or honest about limitations)
- Implementation path is credible

---

### 6. Executive Presentation (15% of assessment)

Present your project to stakeholders:

| Element | What to Include |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Executive Summary** | One-page or one-slide overview |
| **Pitch Deck** | 8-12 slides, presentation-ready |
| **Demo** | Working demonstration of prototype |
| **Q&A Preparation** | Anticipated questions with responses |
| **Leave-Behind** | Detailed documentation for reference |

**Rubric criteria:**
- An executive could make a decision based on this
- Complex ideas are communicated clearly
- Demo is smooth and compelling
- Professional quality throughout

---

## Assessment Rubric

Each component is assessed on a 4-point scale:

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 4 | Exemplary | Exceptional work; could be showcased professionally |
| 3 | Proficient | Meets professional standards; ready for real use |
| 2 | Developing | Shows competence but has notable gaps |
| 1 | Beginning | Significant gaps; requires major revision |

### Overall Scoring

| Component | Weight | Min Score |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Problem Definition | 10% | 3.0 |
| Solution Design | 20% | 3.0 |
| Working Prototype | 25% | 3.0 |
| Governance & Risk | 15% | 3.0 |
| Business Case | 15% | 3.0 |
| Executive Presentation | 15% | 3.0 |

**Minimum to pass:** 3.5 weighted average (higher bar than tracks)
